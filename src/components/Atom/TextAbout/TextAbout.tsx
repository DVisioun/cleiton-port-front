        Hello everyone, my name is Cleiton Moreira, a 3D art student from Brazil
        currently living in Portugal. I work with characters, assets and
        textures for games. I like to learn constantly, because it helps me
        improve my skills and I am constantly looking for new challenges.
        I&#39;m graduated in Game Design from Polytechnic Institute of Bragan√ßa.
